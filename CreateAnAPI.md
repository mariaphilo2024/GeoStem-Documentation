### Create an API
An **API** (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and protocols that allows one software application to interact with another. They enable different applications, services, or platforms to communicate and work together, even if theyâ€™re built on different technologies.

Most common types of APIs. 
- **Web APIs**: APIs designed to be accessed over the web, typically using **HTTP**.

 - **Database API**: Is an interface that allows applications to interact with a database programmatically. 
 
- **Operating System APIs**: APIs provided by operating systems for application development.
 - **Library or Framework APIs**: APIs exposed by libraries or frameworks for specific functionality.
 

Here are the steps to create an API for **Country**. 

 **Step1: Create the Country folder and class in the Domain layer.** 

 ```
namespace GeoStem.Countries
{
    [Audited]
    public class Country : FullAuditedAggregateRoot<Guid>, IHasActive, IHasName, IHasAllRecord
    {
        public Country() { /* This constructor is used by the ORM/database provider */ }
        public Country(Guid id) : base(id)
        {
        }
        public string Code { get; set; }

        public string Name { get; set; }
        public Guid? ContinentId { get; set; }
        public virtual Continent Continent { get; set; }
        public Guid? CurrencyId { get; set; }
        public virtual Currency Currency { get; set; }
        public bool Active { get; set; }
    }
}
```
