### Create an API
An **API** (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and protocols that allows one software application to interact with another. They enable different applications, services, or platforms to communicate and work together, even if theyâ€™re built on different technologies.

There are several types of APIs. 
- **Web APIs**:APIs designed to be accessed over the web, typically using **HTTP**.

 -**Database API**: is an interface that allows applications to interact with a database programmatically. It provides a standardized way for applications to send commands (such as queries, updates, and deletions) to a database and receive responses without directly accessing the underlying database structure.
 **Operating System APIs**:APIs provided by operating systems for application development.
 - **Library or Framework APIs**:APIs exposed by libraries or frameworks for specific functionality.
