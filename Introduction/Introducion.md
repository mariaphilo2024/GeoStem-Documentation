## Introduction
The **GEOSTEM** project is built on the **ABP (ASP.NET Boilerplate Platform)**. ABP is an open-source application framework built on top of .NET. ABP enforces a layered architecture including Application, Domain, Infrastructure, and Presentation layers promoting clean separation of concerns and making it easier to manage dependencies and maintain code. It supports **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** principles and offers guidance for defining entities, value objects, and domain services. . ABP allows to develop applications as a collection of independent modules, which makes it easy to add, replace, or extend functionality. Modules can be reused across multiple projects, and ABP provides a set of pre-built modules to accelerate development.

 The  **GEOSTEM** project consists of two key components: a backend API developed with **ASP.NET-Core** and a front-end UI developed with **Angular**. Both components are built on the **ABP Framework**.
