# XListComponent
XListComponent is  designed to display and manage lists of data. It acts as a dynamic UI element, leveraging dependency injection (e.g., XListParam) to customize its behavior or data source.

## Code Example
```
 this.component = XListComponent;
    this.injector = Injector.create({
      providers: [
        {
          provide: XListParamProvider,
          useValue: new XListParam(xListInput),
        },
      ],
      parent: this.inj,
    });
```
