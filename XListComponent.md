# XListComponent
XListComponent is  designed to display and manage lists of data. It acts as a dynamic UI element, leveraging dependency injection (e.g., XListParam) to customize its behavior or data source.

## Code Example
```
 this.component = XListComponent;
    this.injector = Injector.create({
      providers: [
        {
          provide: XListParamProvider,
          useValue: new XListParam(xListInput),
        },
      ],
      parent: this.inj,
    });
```

### Component Assignment
- **<code>this.component</code>**:  Assigns the <code>XListComponent</code> class to the component property of the current class. It indicates that this property will hold a reference to the <code>XListComponent</code>.
### Injector Creation
- **<code>this.injector</code>**:  Creates a custom dependency injector using Angular's Injector.create() method. The injector is used to resolve and provide dependencies for components dynamically.
