# XPgDetailsComponent
The <code>XPgDetailsComponent</code> is a dynamic Angular component designed to display detailed information about a specific item or entity. It is highly configurable, leveraging injected parameters (e.g., <code>XPgDetailsParam)</code> to customize its behavior and content at runtime. This makes it reusable and adaptable for various use cases where detailed entity views are required.
## Code Example

```typescript
this.component = XPgDetailsComponent;
this.injector = Injector.create({
  providers: [
    {
      provide: XPgDetailsParamProvider,
      useValue: new XPgDetailsParam(xpgDetailsPageConfig),
    },
  ],
  parent: this.inj,
});
```
### Component Assignment
- The <code>XPgDetailsComponent</code> is assigned to the <code>this.component</code> property, preparing it for dynamic rendering.
 ### Injector Creation
An Injector is created using <code>Injector.create()</code>. The configuration includes:

- **Providers**: Specifies the services to inject.
- **XPgDetailsParamProvider**: A provider that uses <code>XPgDetailsParam</code> with the given <code>xpgDetailsPageConfig </code>as its value.
- **Parent Injector**: The parent key refers to <code>this.inj</code>, which serves as the parent injector for resolving additional dependencies.
- **XPgDetailsParam** is a configuration class used to pass parameters to the <code>XPgDetailsComponent</code>. It encapsulates the data and settings required to customize the component's behavior, such as layout, field mappings, or entity-specific details.
- **xpgDetailsPageConfig** is an instance of a configuration object (likely based on the <code>XPgDetailsParam</code> class) that defines the settings and data structure for rendering the <code>XPgDetailsComponent</code>.

- The <code>XPgDetailsComponent</code> is used to render the form on the right side of the image, which provides detailed information about a selected **fuel parameter**.
- Unlike read-only components, <code>XPgDetailsComponent</code> facilitates active user interaction. For instance, users can update fuel parameters (e.g., modifying the maximum density value) and save changes with the provided Save button.
- The <code>XPgDetailsComponent</code> ensures that all entities or parameters in the system use a consistent, reusable interface for managing their details. For example, other entities like Grade Groups or Sulphur could use the same component with their specific configurations.
- In the context of the image, the XPgDetailsComponent is applied to the Fuel Parameter module, enabling users to update properties such as Density @ 15Â°C, its Min/Max values, and associated configurations like GradeSpec or Link Code.
